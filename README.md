# LibAddress

## Description

A library for parsing and formatting addresses based on Google's [AddessValidationMetadata](https://github.com/google/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata).

When building applications for the web, it is often necessary to collect address information from users or companies. However, every country has differents ways of handling addresses.

Wether it is the zip (or postal code) format, the need for a state or province, or the way to format the address itself.

This library aims to provide a simple API for parsing and formatting addresses.

The library is written in TypeScript and is fully typed.
